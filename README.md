## What is Simplify-It?
Simplify-It is a tool that helps you understand complex topics such as Recursion, Optional Chaining, etc that a 5-year-old could understand. 

We've all been there - stuck trying to understand something that seems too complicated. I myself get frustrated while learning some new topics or concepts that go over my head on the initial take.

## How is it built?
Built on top of OpenAI API using prompt `Explain ${keyword} to a 5 year old.` and refined model takes away the pain of constantly writing the same exact prompt in the Chat Open AI and saving your generated results into your account that is authenticated using Firebaseâ€™s Google Authentication. 

## Tech Stack:
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Firebase
- TailwindCSS
- OpenAI API

## Purpose of this app and learnings from building it:
The purpose of this project was to:

- Build a tool that takes away the pain of writing the same prompt over and over again on Chat OpenAI to just writing down the keyword that saves the results for future purposes.
- Learn Typescript. I heard a lot of good things about the features that TypeScript has to offer, so I decided to learn it. Since this was a mini project, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity for me to learn and implement TypeScript.

I am happy with the response that the app got. Within a couple of days of the app going live, the app is at 50+ Sign-ups and 450+ keywords searched.

## TL;DR:
Simplify-It is a tool that helps users understand complex topics in a simple and easy-to-understand way. The tech stack for the project includes TypeScript, NextJS, Firebase, TailwindCSS, and the OpenAI API. The purpose of the app was to build a tool that simplifies the process of searching for information using the Chat OpenAI API and also to learn and implement TypeScript.
